# Data Mining Project - dEclat Algorithm

## dEclatV1

It's a **1st phase** of the Project. This dEclat implementation is based on [that dEclat Java implementation](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/Eclat_dEclat.php)

## dEclatV2

**Second phase** TODO

# TODO List

## Phase 1

- [x] Select algorithm
- [ ] Implement algorithm base on the Java example

## Phase 2

- [ ] Read the article about the algorithm
- [ ] Implement second version of dEclat algorithm

## Report

- [ ] Describe the dEclat algorithm
- [ ] Write the pseudo-code of the dEclat algorithm
- [ ] Describe experiment
- [ ] Prepare test data (source: Twitter)
