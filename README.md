# Data Mining Project - dEclat Algorithm

## dEclatV1

It's a **1st phase** of the Project. This dEclat implementation is based on [that dEclat Java implementation](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/Eclat_dEclat.php).

You can see `Java code` in the `./dEclatV1/dEclat-Java-example/`

## dEclatV2

**Second phase** TODO

# TODO List

## Phase 1

- [x] Select algorithm
- [ ] Implement algorithm base on the Java example

## Phase 2
