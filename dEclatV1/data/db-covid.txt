Estimates of vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection caused by the omicron variant are available from the UK.   After 2 doses: AstraZeneca: not effective?

@stephiekeachie @chrischirp More isn't necessarily better for a vaccine. The advantage of the mRNA vaccines is that it presents just the spike telling the immune system "this is what to look out for". The risk is developing lots of antibodies to things that don't need to be stopped.
@whodatdaddy @reddit_TLCM Natural immunity antibodies don't last- same as the vaccination antibodies.  Natural immunity is talked about-but you have look at actual scientific articles to get facts. Glad you can see the hypocrisy in people calling themselves pro-life-but only for the lives they deem worthy
@cdydev @DrHarryThomas The adenovirus J&amp;J vaccine and the mRNA vaccines produces the same antibodies.  The end product of both is a spike protein that's antigenically the same as the original SCV2 virus spike.  This includes many neutralizing antibodies and some non neutralizing just like all vaxes.

@seanonolennon @Tomaksbaks @Postbro1 @francispouliot_ That's not science. Natural immunity is always more robust and complete. The shot produces immunity to one protein, the spike protein.
