@daniela127 There has only ever been irrational reasons for masking‚Äîperiod. Since the vax doesn‚Äôt stop the spread of COVID it‚Äôs 100% completely irrational to tie masks to vaxxing. Masks were just a fake fix and placeholder for the vax, which is also a fake fix pushed by PLANdemic architects.
@100trillionUSD There's no covid first of all its a new world order agenda implementation is goin on in the name of fake plandemic ....and I m not alone a whole fucking thousands who are protesting against this tyranny
@Langlen @KathrynTewson @RichSeviora @jurijuri @DarksideEevee @Dane_Archetype @Darkdogzstudioz @mystervui @Chazman1189 @MoralJorel Plandemic!   I‚Äôm sure to Cress all of the people who have died from Covid are as fake as her con attendees.
@SidewalkSeedli1 @JLa2685 @washingtonpost why would it matter? people can see the fake news on covid and yet still not believe the truth. The idea that God needs to pop in so people believe is silly. Covid is a perfect example of people seeing and yet choosing not to believe the truth of the plandemic
@skallagram @DavidMichaud53 @stephiebieRN @fordnation @celliottability Well if the fake PCR tests ran at a high cycle were not used, we wouldn't have a plandemic. Further, never isolated COVID virus, let alone Delta or Omicron, but quick to say there's a solution. Don't forget FDA wanted hide data 75 years. Does this sound like JFK?. Gov't cover up?

Covid is a hoax, PCR Test is fake, this is a movie PLANDEMIC
The plandemic of covid has certainly lifted the lid of the criminal drug industry. It also raised my awareness of the MMR jabs being in the same deadly fake ballpark.  If I knew back in the 90s what I know now, my kids would not have been jabbed. Luckily they are all OK üòê https://t.co/fY6inlQAQv
@TheoFleury14 "Plandemic?" If you are so quick to downplay and real health issue like Covid, then maybe I should deny the facts about addiction. It's not a real disease? You were just faking it for attention? Right? Your trauma is fake man. It's just a selfish act.
@normonics @RaheemKassam 1255 Australians died from flu in 2017.  That's 50% more than died *with* COVID during any year of this fake plandemic, and that's with tnem counting every death with a positive PCR test as a "COVID death" regardless of the actual cause of death. https://t.co/A07ghrv9Mb

@adulttamagotchi @CBCToronto They have finally admitted it. SARS cov 1 was airborne and so is SARS cov 2. Covid. It is airborne people. Wear a mask in crowds or indoors when out of your house. Im sure Ugiri event was not adhereing to safety precautions very well. We need pics.
@Clint_ZA There is no such thing as a covid test Clint. You can't test for covid. Covid is a disease. It has to be diagnosed.  The test is for SARS COV2.  Testing positive for SARS doesn't imply covid.  But I know you don't care about getting shit correct.

@WebDeflector A Melbourne, Australia researcher was one of the first to espouse its benefits, then suddenly - radio silence on the topic. I believe Uttar Predesh, India followed the findings and all but eradicated Covid in their region. https://t.co/ovWW1xzGob
@JohnJNazarian SARS-Cov-2. Covid is caused by scurvy &amp; Trained innate immunity (Chinnaswamy). A new concept in immunology. (Kangas2021).  This is why all dogs in India &amp; US have recovered from Covid.  20 S. States of India feared for the worst, but they have reached 69% natural immunity

@luce_iii @portarican_RT I can‚Äôt show you COVID because the part of it you can see is called SARS-CoV-2. It looks like this image, but if you‚Äôre as stupid as you appear to be, the image won‚Äôt mean anything to you. https://t.co/xpQcYWv5El
The virus looks like the corona under the microscope of scientists,hence the name coronavirus. Coronavirus is widespread in the nature, and most of it are harmless. But COVID-19, also knonwn as SARS-Cov-II, is the third type of coronavirus brin‚Ä¶ Devamƒ±nƒ± G√∂r

@AnayahUnique @axhleighlouise You haven‚Äôt bothered to read the article I sent so there‚Äôs no point continuing to talk to you. ‚ÄòUsually‚Äô they do yes.

Getting lots of Qs about how I am dealing with holidays given Omicron is taking over. You get infected by inhaling virus from air. 1. Get boosted 2. Wear KF94 or a verified N95. 3. Avoid (or limit time in) indoor spaces with people not wearing masks (bars/restaurants/gyms). (1/2)

Not sure who needs to hear this, but please postpone any unnecessary travel and gatherings right now.   The virus doesn‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs the holidays. Your vaccine wont do much to prevent infection or transmission of Omicron. Please don‚Äôt be part of the problem. üôè

@CP24 You have the vaccine get omicron.  Natural immunity with mild symptoms. You are not vaccinated get omicron natural immunity with mild symptoms.  Happy holidays.  The virus will eradicate itself.  Move on.  Let 2022 be a real new year.  Not a new world.
