@EstherMcVey1 Phizer data???? What a joke!!! Government want to close the country based on Phizer data, so the can push Phizer product on people living in fear. ü•¥
@TxTiger72 @PhilsandJenn Like you believing CNN's horror stories about Covid. You know Phizer is a major sponsor right? Just like the flu a few get really sick and die. Also like the flu most get sick for a few days and then get better,  like me. I am awaiting a lung transplant and got sick for 1 day

@WonPeople @tonx10 Unless Labour win a GE I can't see Jews being sent to concentration camps, now as for the unvaxxed (which I guess includes me as I had my first two AZ jabs but will not have a Phizer or Moderna mRNA booster) - that is a different matter.  Just my opinion, feel free to disagree.
@JuliaHB1 It's strange how Phizer can confirm this data within weeks of the Omicron yet want over 50 years to produce data on vaccine issues etc.
@kekule6 @TheProjectUnity Propaganda? It's literally the only data phizer has released that has to do with their trials. And it's from a FOIA, It's just data they have released. Data is Propaganda now? To who's benefit? What's the Propaganda pushing?
@GBNEWS Concerning for Phizer, maybe, as their huge profit grab seems less sustainable now. "But it was meant to be a twice yearly subscription!"
@Pollard24588134 @Margari48049649 @vicderbyshire Sounds like you are listening to the propaganda of big pharma. The shareholders of Phizer thank you.
@TheProjectUnity https://t.co/7k9wu4RvqH Why would phizer want 55+ years to release all information regarding their "safe and effective" product? Seems to me they would be excited and enthused to release such info to further vaccination rate. Whats to hide?
@Derek_Rankin If phizer points out that the hundredth jab are fully vaccinated, your 99 jabs vaccine pass is counted as invalid for partially vaccinated.

@DrEricDing @VIRAL_FR What does this mean for ages 5-11 who only just received their two shots of phizer ? Especially as children more vulnerable to omicron ?
@AmandaMcCrary3 @LizardLestrange The last 2 days have been the biggest middle finger, I had my second shot of phizer and they said when I got my first that a small chance for males under 30  to get heart inflammation and I got it never had so much pain in my life and recovering from that still.

@CharlieHocking @SpeakingasI @JonMotivates @ClarkAndy18 @piersmorgan Exactly. The boss of Phizer was on TV foaming at the mouth at the prospect of multiple jabs each year for everyone including kids.

Is it finally all going to unravel for the vaccine companies?  It‚Äôs a nice thought, but when Phizer alone made 280 million a day in the first quarter of 2021, I don‚Äôt think so.  This will be swept under the carpet and they‚Äôll be turned into conspiracy theorists. https://t.co/sCVzCp6Q1b

@lukas_impact @darkcuriou @garic3712 @MailOnline If any of that were true, Phizer would be giving doses to the third world by releasing the patent. 2/3 of the world is unvaxxed, your utopia of total vax is a pipe dream because big pharma is making way too much money selling boosters to the west

@Serge948969121 @mrembula_T @aginnt I honestly think the Epstein scandal triggered it. The economy was a by product of the plandemic. Which is works to further their plan.

@ShirtytrisH People have become dicks since the plandemic,  Everyone is too angry. Especially me.
@RWTaylors @talkRADIO @GBNEWS If the media had done their job in 2020 there would have been no plandemic in the first place. I do not recall a serious, challenging question being asked of Johnson, Whitty &amp; Hancock etc in April 2020. The shallowness of the media has been totally exposed, or they're part of it.
And according to @who 3.4% would die. It turns out it is nothing at all like that and here we are... Plandemic gets harder and harder to ignore as crazy talk. https://t.co/h4KuqHhkV0

@ggreenwald You are not allowed answers, don't question big Pharma or the CDC or they lock you up next. Like I've said when the plandemic was first announced, this is no accident. Like 9/11 , its war on the 99%, not war drugs, terrorists, viruses, but US! You can't have this many accidents

@MrDamienBlack All the smart, healthy people.  Probably about 20-30% in Canada, a bit more in the US.  Gov statistics on this are bullshit,  as was their complicity in the mismanagement of this entire "plandemic".
@SojournerMrs @panolan2 A LIE not based or supported by science and she knows it! It‚Äôs an indoctrination of children to begin breaking their free will so the next attempt at a plandemic and shift to socialism/communism is met with less resistance
@erinotoole And‚Ä¶Toronto always votes this looser in they love the libs. Know a ton of people waiting for this plandemic to end and getting outta here. Bye Canada.
@ccowboy723 Yes and believe that Democrats have been refining their technique for decades.  The plandemic gave them an opportunity to go for the big steal.
@straight_batter I believe there is more illegal immigrants than 500.000 so this is impossible I live and see this everyday pal and I am yet to be convinced that there is a pandemic only plandemic I see is millions of illegal immigrants and vaxx death we are bein invaded and a war my man
@SenJeffMerkley @BCTGM Kellogg made huge profits during the plandemic? That upsets you? Maybe you should follow their plan and stop running us into more debt.
@DocMCohen I was also a hater of Maxime Bernier 'till the "plandemic" started &amp; I realized a lot of the right know exactly what's going on because they were originally part of the planning process. He's been excommunicated so--he's releasing some of the intel. You're a political neophyte.
