@MichaelWorobey Too late. Non-virologists are going to reform lab safety because virologists are too stupid to do it themselves. All the surveillance did nothing whatsoever to help and likely caused the pandemic. Why else was Wuhan the epicenter, but that viruses were shipped to it in bulk?
@dupui It was tracked to Wuhan, China.  Once they tracked it to the city, their "theory" became: it came from the meat market near the lab that is working on "gain of function" on #Covid_19. ü§î The question of lab or meat market should be obvious,  but biden protects his comrade China.
@DanielPrantner @KelseyTuoc You are uninformed. babar l'elephant believes in zoonosis. He is extremely knowledgable and rigorous. I am dubious of a zoonotic origin. The facts are sparse. I weight the the lack of initial genetic diversity and the nature of the research in Wuhan heavily towards man made.

I‚Äôm old enough to remember when ‚Äòantibodies‚Äô and ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô were widely recognized scientific concepts.
Understand that ATAGI has now approved getting that 3rd booster shot at 5 months, and that Moderna is also approved for boosting. It bumps your antibodies right up and gives you your best chance of avoiding being sick with delta or omicron.
The way you know Covid is political is the ‚Äúpublic health‚Äù authorities don‚Äôt give a damn about antibodies or herd immunity. There are no ‚Äòpolicy tradeoffs.‚Äô They don‚Äôt say age &amp; obesity are huge risks. They dare not mention therapeutics.  It‚Äôs all about the jabs. Huge red flag.
@johnnyo317 @SaucedaMacias @uconnstacey @OccupyDemocrats And you are a perfect example of why this country is going to hell. Everyone only cares about their sorry-ass self. I feel bad for you.

How is anyone surprised our government went out flouting covid rules last year? I went out and met whoever I wanted. None of got covid or spread it, because we aren‚Äôt idiots.
@BernieSpofforth @AmandaHunter10 Unlike the Bolshevik revolution where people put up posters pretending to support the government out of fear of being jailed or killed. This one, because they are idiots and cowards.
