@teslafsdbeta Replacing faulty/missing neurons with circuits is the right way to think about it. Many problems can be solved just bridging signals between existing neurons.  Progress will accelerate when we have devices in humans (hard to have nuanced conversations with monkeys) next year.
@newsmax There are already minimum age requirements for the House, Senate &amp; Presidency. Reciprocally, there should be maximum age limits too.
@stocktalkweekly @neuralink I am definitely not saying that we can for sure do this, but I am increasingly confident that it is possible
@ICannot_Enough @kimpaquette Exactly

@Tesmanian_com The magnitude of the Starship program is not widely appreciated. It is designed to extend life to Mars (and the moon), which requires ~1000 times more payload to orbit than all current Earth rockets combined.
@Erdayastronaut Yes
@Tesmanian_com If a severe global recession were to dry up capital availability / liquidity while SpaceX was losing billions on Starlink &amp; Starship, then bankruptcy, while still unlikely, is not impossible.  GM &amp; Chrysler went BK last recession.  ‚ÄúOnly the paranoid survive.‚Äù ‚Äì Grove
@micsolana The overarching problem is that we need better mental firewalls for the information constantly coming at us.   Critical &amp; first principles thinking should be a required course in middle school.  Who wrote the software running in your head? Are you sure you actually want it there?
@Rubix161 @thesheetztweetz @GerberKawasaki It‚Äôs getting fixed
@TeslaGong @GerberKawasaki Suits will need to be made in high volume at an affordable cost &amp; be much easier to use
@GerberKawasaki We had to shift some Starlink satellite orbits to reduce probability of collision. Not great, but not terrible either.  Station &amp; Dragon have micrometeorite shields (ultra high velocity impact absorption), but EVA suits do not, hence higher risk for spacewalk.

@ajtourville We learned our lesson with $465M DoE loan received in 2010/2011 ‚Äì onerous terms exceed value of money received. That‚Äôs why we paid it back so early, despite an early repayment penalty.

@SawyerMerritt Such miracles are beyond us
@PPathole @Teslarati @13ericralph31 If we are able to make life self-sustaining on Mars, we will have passed one of the greatest filters. That then sets us up to become interstellar.

@Teslarati @13ericralph31 This will be really important one day.   Much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on Earth, but there were far more that ‚Äúmerely‚Äù destroyed a continent.

@cz_binance @CoinDesk @binance @egreechee Sounds good
@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog It can simulate anywhere, but we need to focus on one region until FSD is out of beta, then expand geographically to have betas in other countries. Canada is not a lot different from US, but different enough.
@WholeMarsBlog High-performance code is in C using our own compiler to maximize frame rate. We use Python with custom libraries for fast prototyping, then convert to C for fast execution.  New software is run against real-world video &amp; our world simulator to evaluate performance, then QA.
@cz_binance @CoinDesk @binance @egreechee I don‚Äôt use Binance (tried at one point, but signup was too many hoops to jump through), so no inconvenience to me personally. Just raising this issue on behalf of other Doge holders.
@WholeMarsBlog Our NNs didn‚Äôt have any temporal &amp; spatial memory or surround video auto-labeling back then ‚Äì everything was knitted together in C++ from single frames with manual labeling.  Still much to improve.
