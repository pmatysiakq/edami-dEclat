@mslavco @SamirGunic @haveibeenpwned I’ll put it another way: there are 11.7B records in @haveibeenpwned and less than 1% of them came from MD5 hashes. It’s a *very* unique situation and certainly not one I can justify spending significant time catering for.
@HereSeanTalks It would differ by site, there’s no uniform way of requested your data be removed

@SamirGunic @mslavco @haveibeenpwned There’s really no point, it’s extraordinarily rare to have emails as a hash and not in plain text. I mean, think about it: what possible reason would a provider store them in a non-reversible fashion? Gravatar is a unique use case.

@PixieCannibal Agree re parenting. The point is that even with the Twitter controls, porn is easily accessed by those who want it and a hard age gate on actual porn sites doesn’t change its easy access.

@mattaustin @rishi_singh86 @haveibeenpwned That’s in no way comparable. When someone pulls a huge volume of data from Twitter in a way it’s not intended to be accessed then redistributes it around for others to abuse, yes, I’ll want to see that notification.

I hate getting emails from this guy 😭 https://t.co/rkZrmzU7hp
@AlkalineMoon @haveibeenpwned Not AFAIK, why would it?
Oh - one more thing: personally, this won't stop me using Gravatar. I'm sympathetic to tech platforms providing services that by design, make data public and easily accessible but then need to defend against scraping. It's a hard problem.
@omkelderman Emails send out alphabetically and I’m about half way through
@nightpool https://t.co/tk4oUJtCpK
At the very least, it's awareness. I want to know - *most* people want to know - when our personal data appears in places we didn't expect it to, and that's precisely what @haveibeenpwned does.
What can you actually do about it? People often request that the impacted service delete their data. That obviously doesn't put the genie back in the bottle, but it's a reasonable action once trust is eroded.
My data is in the Gravatar scrap (and it was in the LinkedIn scrape) and I agree. It's not massive in the scheme of things, but it's still frustrating and I want to know about it.
The argument of "well, it's public data anyway" is a view held by the minority. The vast majority of people consistently say "I didn't expect my data to be used in this way and I'm unhappy it's now out there and being passed around in this format".
Searching Twitter for your own polls is painful, but the results were consistent when asking about prior scraping incidents such as Facebook and LinkedIn earlier this year.
For example, when Epik scraped and stored WHOIS records: https://t.co/w6Po1D5BU9
Getting a few questions related to whether scraped data such as from Gravatar is worthy of being in @haveibeenpwned. Without exception, every time I ask how people feel about this, the overwhelming majority of people say "I want to know when this happens".
Anyone else? I sent “a few”… https://t.co/TdVxiggnAc
@Crackmacs Me too 😔
@jroper @haveibeenpwned Every time I poll this, the responses are overwhelmingly in favour of loading scraped data. Incidents like this show the misuse of data (including mine) and possible actions include people requesting the impacted service to delete their account. Plus, it’s easily ignorable 🙂
@varseand @drewrants I get your point, but it just puts us back at that same position where it’s a privacy compromise again and is unlikely to happen
Next round of #pwnedmas winner emails about to go out to the USA, UK and New Zealand. Here’s what’s left of the book stash: https://t.co/0oTgnumDbB
@varseand And that’s never gonna happen, it’s entirely counter to the “P” in VPN!

@RanAriGur Not really relevant, Edge can still calculate a SHA-1 hash client side and send it to the API
@varseand So… VPN. Done.
@jrmassar @IRMA_privacy If it’s a solved problem, why aren’t we seeing it on the sites in question?
😎 https://t.co/8dcGf9Vjnq https://t.co/4UmREleXUL
@nic0god If you don’t know, you don’t need it 🙂  But here’s the answer anyway: https://t.co/QP2TfqnSta
Lastly, this is also why I’m so adamant about this position:  “Digital Parental Controls Are Not a Substitute for Actual Parenting”  https://t.co/NBfuHXwUYw
This isn’t to justify the lack of appropriate age controls on websites, rather to recognise that it’s a much harder problem than what is trivialised by politicians. Preserving anonymity and freedom of expression whilst showing age appropriate content is extremely non-trivial.
I accidentally stumbled across this recently (honestly!) when searching for the @rodemics account. The first search result was very similar; without clicking over to videos, it was right there up the top, very explicit and very in my face.
So, there’s obviously a conscious attempt to exclude porn if not from the platform, then at least from the search results. But now, search for “rode”… or don’t, just see the (carefully cropped) screen cap below: https://t.co/ltje20N4AQ
Maybe nobody on Twitter wants porn? Let’s try an image search… that’s actually really cool! No nudity, just cool galaxies. https://t.co/3L2T3PArsu
Twitter has obviously made a conscious attempt to exclude porn from search results. Trying searching for “porn” videos and see what it gets you… or just look at this screen cap: https://t.co/lLnWCt5Rcw
The other problem is that when it comes to limiting access to porn, putting a hard age gate on websites is only the tip of the iceberg. Let me demonstrate with an easy example (you might not want to try this from work):
Which, of course, means eroding anonymity and we’re talking about precisely the sort of service where for many people, privacy is important. Doing identity proof whilst preserving anonymity is a hard problem to solve.
But this is a much more nuanced challenge than the article suggests, starting with this problem: “a form of age assurance where users are asked to provide formal proof of their identity through passports, credit cards or other forms of identification known as hard identifiers”.
Age verification for porn sites is in the news again. The basic premise is that a “hard proof” should be provided before people access porn to ensure they’re adults (apparently kids lie in response to the “are you 18 or over” questions 🤷‍♂️). https://t.co/18AjgbBqUS
You can presently download hashes in both SHA-1 and NTLM format, but only query the k-anonymity API vis SHA-1, not NTLM. Would NTLM API queries be useful for you? And if so, why?
Pwned Passwords in @haveibeenpwned is approaching a major milestone with a V8 release continuing hundreds of millions of new passwords, then the launch of the @FBI ingestion pipeline so they can feed in passwords discovered in their investigations. More agencies will join later.

@xn__mn8hzg @RThopalong It’s a question of age appropriateness: what’s appropriate for my 9 year old daughter will change when she’s older. For now, this is appropriate and consistent with most child development guidelines for kids going online.

These recommendations really aren't aging well... https://t.co/m6gZhztlhK https://t.co/KOLSWX6wTC
This is interesting: 6 days before the whistleblower piece, but also begs the question: how was Surfshark VPN linked back to him? Feds could have worked backwards and looked at which Ubiquiti insiders had paid for VPN services, seems like a profoundly dumb thing for him to do. https://t.co/FRLC3tYFfW
It only takes one slip-up... https://t.co/AM4gdYI3D4  Reminds me of that old saying about defenders needing to get it right all the time and attackers only needing to succeed once. Well, the attacker *also* has to get their opsec right all the time!
@eduitguy @delumini @Scott_Helme @Ubiquiti I can see multiple factors that would have influenced the way they communicated. However, it's hard to imagine there weren't options that would have mitigated damage further especially as rumours and misinformation ran unchecked.
Plus, there's the question of how one individual acting alone (AFAIK) managed to wreak such havoc. I imagine that's something they'll be reflecting deeply on and as unpleasant as this is for them, I'd expect it to strengthen their controls and security posture.
So @Ubiquiti was certainly the victim, but there are still things they could have done differently. The "vacuum of information" comment here is apt (but also, read the thread and see how the "whistleblower" really threw them under the bus) https://t.co/YsGNHEHJAE
This headline is what really grabbed attention back in March: https://t.co/LntVyy8Odo  Of course @briankrebs couldn't have known at the time that the "whistleblower" was actually the perpetrator and given the guy's internal knowledge, he could have easily appeared authentic.
Whoa! At the time, I felt ⁦@Ubiquiti⁩ should have been more transparent in their communication of this breach, I need to go back and read what was said then in light of this story. This guy certainly did a number on them. https://t.co/YxoeIYDYHe
