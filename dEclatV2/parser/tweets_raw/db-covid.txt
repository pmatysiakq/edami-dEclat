Nobody ever bothered me at work until they offered a public sign up sheet on Google docs and noticed my name was not on the form. They originally offered us Moderna, which works better than Phizer (as we see from time studies). But last minute they switched to the P.

@PhxHellas @Steve_Irvin Yes, make no mistake, and in 75 years when Phizer comes out with the last of it data for this genetheropy...history will be judged..just no one around from this time to see it
@canarygeezer07 It does reduce the spread, and the Moderna and Phizer vaccines work on preventing you catching the virus, whereas Astrazenica helps you if you get the virus. Please get your facts right before correcting me.

Exactly. That‚Äôs why millions of parents need to NOT throw away thousands of years of tried &amp; true common sense to obey billionaires pushing masks, lockdowns and telling them to inject their kids with an experimental ‚Äòvax‚Äô for a seasonal virus that doesn‚Äôt threaten their lives. https://t.co/HB06TbHKNy

@adsquires Thanks. I don't think it means it's over, by any means, but it could mean that initial estimates of Omicron's transmission advantage over Delta slightly overstate the difference.  That would, in turn, mean you end up with slightly fewer cases overall.

Looks like Republican Governors cared far more about as little disruptions as possible for kids school year. While Dems used &amp; abused this plandemic any which way they could. Sad
January is going to be interesting. The infection rate of Omicon 7-10 suggests it's going to make this endemic and effectively end the plandemic. While the government is going to try to make that take as long as possible. They need another scariant. Will Pi be wheeled out?
One thing the PLANdemic did was to expose the mentally unstable and fragile people in society.... And we see that there are SO MANY   ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@ashishkjha @Craig_A_Spencer This plandemic is over. What's next?
The pandemic was a ‚Äúplandemic.‚Äù Climate change isn‚Äôt real! There‚Äôs a secret cabal running the world!  I feel like conspiracy theorists have never had a to be a project manager overseeing more than, let‚Äôs say, 6 people.
@DickDelingpole We have a pandemic of stupidity!! FFS these people are morons. Health and safety removed natural selection, this plandemic has found another means of reducing stupidity in society
@NellzLinn I swab as a hustle and I have many stories combating this PLANDEMIC. I worked in a hospital and saw THE REAL. @HoodHealer remember when you added me on live in 2020. I wanted to tell u so much but I was at work. I‚Äôd still love to have that convo! It‚Äôs a GAME

@libertyspot @mail_american Most do not know enough.  Every leader has a responsibility to expose this covid plandemic for what it really is.  Depopulation, slavery, and a return to way things were during the Roman Empire, a ruling elite class and a slavery class.
@HighburyHawk @ZubyMusic Wow! Suddenly in the year of Covid plandemic, footballers are collapsing on the pitch around the world. When did we ever have these incidents occur at this rate in football ever?!!
Let‚Äôs say it out loud, being Politically correct is not working the Pandemic is a Political Plandemic.  This has never been about Health. All previous Pandemics have caused the World Population to decrease. Covid-19 has actually caused a increase. So the WHO Vaccine is a failure.
The evidence is mounting. But these murderers have complete impunity. #plandemic https://t.co/1nF2Ue8zg1

@simsbeezy If you honestly think it‚Äôs the EU running European union you‚Äôre deluded . Domestic politics around the world is just theatre to give the impression of democracy . This plandemic and what is happening is all being orchestrated by the WEF. The reset in action .
@VivekKhashu @Iromg How many of these positive "cases" are actually people with symptoms? Asymptomtic spread is at the heart of the plandemic scam and millions of idiots still believe it to be a thing.
#MondayMorning #PLANDEMIC Created in Wuhan Lab..Effective treatments blocked..Vaccines mandated, with no liability..The most vaccinated countries have biggest outbreaks..Are you beginning to understand? https://t.co/aKQfV4zGqU
@McKaylaRoseJ Follow my Twitter and you will see what a scam the plandemic is. You can scroll for days and see the deaths I tweeted from the vaxxine. Also how it's connected to radiation sickness
@AmberX994874 I wonder if the whole show is just that. We know factually the PCR is junk and the CDC will no longer use it after the 31 December. Is this the cover for dumping it after they have pushed it so hard as the gold standard? All of the plandemic is a soapie
@brgunn83 @Cammos78 @reinburr Plandemic
@GovWhitmer Bribing people to forget your abuse of them all through the #plandemic. Doesn‚Äôt undo anything.
@virtuistics @spookymvmii @Surgeon_General Turns out this man is speaking truth!!! Imagine labeled a HERO at the beginning of the plandemic, Medical staff  working  in the raw only to be outcasted by your peers because you have proven natural immunity over a forced vaccine that doesn‚Äôt prevent transmission or infection?
RT @WellsCordoba: @TaIkMMA_ #COVID19 is a political scamdemic and plandemic.
A few years before the #plandemic, evil people like Satan Klaus, Kill Gates, and the Norwegian crime minister were openly bragging about their plans. Wake up, people. https://t.co/2WnzuwZxpQ https://t.co/CnOmKE1AJ8
