@karpathy All of reality can be simulated with ones &amp; zeroes
@lexfridman Yeah, the smarter someone is, the harder it is to simulate/predict their behavior
@BillyM2k Now that the Webb telescope has been launched, they will have to spend more on rendering haha
@BillyM2k It is simulations all the way down, until you get to one bit
@PPathole People are able to break any laws made by humans, but none made by physics
Physics formulas are the rendering rules
So much of AI is about compressing reality to a small vector space, like a video game in reverse
@stats_feed @engineers_feed Useful mass to orbit is what matters

@nichegamer It‚Äôs good
@PPathole @Tesla That was a crazy tough year. Tesla financing closed at 6pm Christmas Eve ‚Äì last hour of the last day possible. Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas.
@cyantist It was a shamefully low blow from WSJ

Tesla holiday software update goes to wide release today!
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla is technically a car like an iPhone is technically a phone
10.8 looks good, rolling out today
@BLKMDL3 Good idea
@BillyM2k @jack @gladstein @rahilla @farokh @samkazemian @TheSmarmyBum @ethereum That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pro Doge

Lots of Tesla cars to deliver before year end! Your support in taking delivery is much appreciated.   Thanks also to the Tesla team working hard during the holidays!
@scottwww @realrobcopeland Yeah, I didn‚Äôt have a house in the Bay Area for over a decade, despite spending half the week there

@nurodev Disney restricted us to US only
@JeffTutorials Yes, but if we find unexpected bugs, release might be delayed until 24th
@WillFealey Yes
Tesla holiday software release being tested with internal owners today. Broader rollout starts tomorrow evening.
@WholeMarsBlog We‚Äôre aiming for a significant improvement for owners outside the US around March, depending on regulatory approvals
@Gfilche It‚Äôs a great whistle!
@Tesmanian_com When the 10b preprogrammed sales complete. There are still a few tranches left, but almost done.
@BillyM2k @daelmor @DanCrenshawTX üíØ
@WholeMarsBlog This assumes completion of the 10b sales
@cleantechnica Pure vision, especially when using explicit photon count, is much better than radar+vision, as the latter has too much ambiguity ‚Äì when radar &amp; vision disagree, it is not clear which one to believe
@nichegamer ü§£
@teslatidbits @WholeMarsBlog @DanCrenshawTX A strong bias towards consumption tax makes sense
@daelmor @BillyM2k @DanCrenshawTX ü§£ People who don‚Äôt create products &amp; services don‚Äôt realize that it takes hard work to produce products &amp; services
@DanCrenshawTX Agreed. Taxes do need to be collected, but what is the best way to do this that maximizes area under the curve of the happiness of the people?

@F9Block5 10.8
@F9Block5 Coming
@BLKMDL3 10.8 is close, so just jumping to that
@BLKMDL3 Probably
@johnkrausphotos @NASASpaceflight Haha, this is not even its final form! Although, pretty close.   Cape is hopefully this summer.
Tesla FSD 10.8 plus holiday fun software release probably Tuesday
@johnkrausphotos @NASASpaceflight The ship is just begging for three more vacuum engines to be added. Tanks will stretch for more propellant load.
@Space__Biscuit @NASASpaceflight 15 degrees
@NASASpaceflight Yup. Next booster will have 33 Raptor 2 engines, with 13 steering.   Ship is being upgraded to 9 engines (3 sea-level gimbaling, 6 vacuum fixed) with increased propellant load.
Each Raptor 1 engine above produces 185 metric tons of force. Raptor 2 just started production &amp; will do 230+ tons or over half a million pounds of force.
