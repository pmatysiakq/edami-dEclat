@engineers_feed The resolution of the universe is not smaller than Planck length https://t.co/hoyZR4d0pP
@karpathy All of reality can be simulated with ones &amp; zeroes
@lexfridman Yeah, the smarter someone is, the harder it is to simulate/predict their behavior
@BillyM2k Now that the Webb telescope has been launched, they will have to spend more on rendering haha
@BillyM2k It is simulations all the way down, until you get to one bit
@PPathole People are able to break any laws made by humans, but none made by physics
Physics formulas are the rendering rules
So much of AI is about compressing reality to a small vector space, like a video game in reverse
@stats_feed @engineers_feed Useful mass to orbit is what matters

That said, still a long way to go to replace the fleet of combustion vehicles on the road.

Merry Christmas 🎄🎁 ⛄️ ⭐️ 😃
@JonErlichman Or Tesla!
Interesting https://t.co/548FHpnnxU
@nichegamer It’s good
@PPathole @Tesla That was a crazy tough year. Tesla financing closed at 6pm Christmas Eve – last hour of the last day possible. Payroll would otherwise have bounced two days after Christmas.
@cyantist It was a shamefully low blow from WSJ
RT @Tesla: Complete list of features here. Happy holidays! → https://t.co/7DhUW0KUgO
@WholeMarsBlog And many other things
@davidjkon @Tesmanian_com No, that’s some tool with senior editor privileges who keeps putting that there
@Tesmanian_com “History is written by the victors” except on Wikipedia, as your enemies are still alive &amp; have lots of time on their hands 🤣🤣
@Tesmanian_com My wiki is such a dumpster fire 🤣🤣. That’s how you know it isn’t curated.
@GerberKawasaki A lot will be added
Tesla holiday software update goes to wide release today!
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla is technically a car like an iPhone is technically a phone
10.8 looks good, rolling out today
@BLKMDL3 Good idea
@BillyM2k @jack @gladstein @rahilla @farokh @samkazemian @TheSmarmyBum @ethereum That’s why I’m pro Doge
The @SkepticsGuide book is 👍
Lots of Tesla cars to deliver before year end! Your support in taking delivery is much appreciated.   Thanks also to the Tesla team working hard during the holidays!
@scottwww @realrobcopeland Yeah, I didn’t have a house in the Bay Area for over a decade, despite spending half the week there
Whereas radar has trouble seeing small pedestrians, they’re obvious to Tesla vision https://t.co/ANUy58lgl7
@nurodev Disney restricted us to US only
@JeffTutorials Yes, but if we find unexpected bugs, release might be delayed until 24th
@WillFealey Yes
Tesla holiday software release being tested with internal owners today. Broader rollout starts tomorrow evening.
@WholeMarsBlog We’re aiming for a significant improvement for owners outside the US around March, depending on regulatory approvals
@Gfilche It’s a great whistle!
@Tesmanian_com When the 10b preprogrammed sales complete. There are still a few tranches left, but almost done.
@BillyM2k @daelmor @DanCrenshawTX 💯
@WholeMarsBlog This assumes completion of the 10b sales
@cleantechnica Pure vision, especially when using explicit photon count, is much better than radar+vision, as the latter has too much ambiguity – when radar &amp; vision disagree, it is not clear which one to believe
@nichegamer 🤣
@teslatidbits @WholeMarsBlog @DanCrenshawTX A strong bias towards consumption tax makes sense
@daelmor @BillyM2k @DanCrenshawTX 🤣 People who don’t create products &amp; services don’t realize that it takes hard work to produce products &amp; services
@DanCrenshawTX Agreed. Taxes do need to be collected, but what is the best way to do this that maximizes area under the curve of the happiness of the people?
@harald_murphy @SpaceX @Tesla @Jays200 A lot of improvement still coming just from software updates to satellites &amp; terminals
RT @NASA: Stage separation confirmed! The @SpaceX Dragon is now floating freely and flying toward the @Space_Station with science, supplies…
@Erdayastronaut I talked about Falcon 9 &amp; Heavy for over a decade!
@PPathole Still kinda hard to believe it is working
@PPathole @SpaceX Absolutely
100th SpaceX rocket landing was today https://t.co/ysO9siYCee
@BillyM2k Just keep going. It’s in there somewhere. https://t.co/jSLEIcXji1

Has anyone seen web3? I can’t find it.
@BillyM2k With Starlink, you could stream video &amp; play online games
🤣🤣 True. Ask your airline for Starlink! https://t.co/R9GL2bKOAT
@pbdes @JeanMarc_Nasr @esa @SpaceX Game on
@omarsar0 👍
@JayinShanghai Sometime in 2022
@BillyM2k 🤣
@imoriginalankit Maybe I’m partly Chinese!
For those wondering, I will pay over $11 billion in taxes this year
@lexfridman Yeah
I’m not suggesting web3 is real – seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now – just wondering what the future will be like in 10, 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic!
@WorldAndScience Might very well be
Given the almost unimaginable nature of the present, what will the future be? https://t.co/b2Yw0AXGVA
@GailAlfarATX @peterdog15 @Tesla Tesla will hold a Giga Texas grand opening party with factory tours for the community in early 2022
@stevenmarkryan @neuralink Words are very lossy compression of thoughts
@teslaownersSV @SpaceX Long way to go to perfect it, but Starship is really next-level
@Erdayastronaut @SkepticsGuide Sounds like a good book
@wintonARK It may, especially in our galaxy at this time

@NASASpaceflight Still aiming for booster 4 &amp; Ship 20 for first orbital test flight (this is pure coincidence!)
@F9Block5 10.8
@F9Block5 Coming
@BLKMDL3 10.8 is close, so just jumping to that
@BLKMDL3 Probably
@johnkrausphotos @NASASpaceflight Haha, this is not even its final form! Although, pretty close.   Cape is hopefully this summer.
Tesla FSD 10.8 plus holiday fun software release probably Tuesday
@johnkrausphotos @NASASpaceflight The ship is just begging for three more vacuum engines to be added. Tanks will stretch for more propellant load.
@Space__Biscuit @NASASpaceflight 15 degrees
@NASASpaceflight Yup. Next booster will have 33 Raptor 2 engines, with 13 steering.   Ship is being upgraded to 9 engines (3 sea-level gimbaling, 6 vacuum fixed) with increased propellant load.
Each Raptor 1 engine above produces 185 metric tons of force. Raptor 2 just started production &amp; will do 230+ tons or over half a million pounds of force.
Starship Super Heavy engine steering test https://t.co/VG4RQAGuyk
@CathieDWood Interesting
@heydave7 @JohnnaCrider1 @SenWarren @buckporno The great state of Massachusetts deserves someone better
@JohnnaCrider1 @SenWarren @buckporno This is such a deeply messed up lie to the American people. She is the one freeloading off taxpayers, while I’m paying the largest amount of tax of any individual in history.   Is @SenWarren really someone we want as a US senator?
@EvaFoxU @cnunezimages Still much to be done, but it has that potential
@BBC_Future This is a big deal
@JeanMar49190094 @teslaownersSV It might be
@itsALLrisky Wow, this video took a lot of work!
@StianWalgermo @TeslaCharging @Tesla @WholeMarsBlog @TeslaClubNorway Trondheim sounds cool

@TeslaOwnersEBay @PPathole @ScottAdamsSays @johniadarola @SenWarren It’s complicated, but hopefully out next quarter, along with Witcher. Lot of internal debate as to whether we should be putting effort towards generalized gaming emulation vs making individual games work well.

@24_7TeslaNews @Tesla ❤️
@ScottAdamsSays @johniadarola @SenWarren I love Dilbert! Use it all the time to illustrate that we’re doing something wrong at Tesla/SpaceX if it could be a Dilbert cartoon irl. This happens more often than I’d like (sigh).

@americafirstmg Explain yourself @SenWarren
@americafirstmg What a hypocrite!
@americafirstmg Interesting
@fttechnews Thank you!
@OwenSparks_ @Erdayastronaut Yup, that’s the plan!
@SenWarren Don’t spend it all at once … oh wait you did already
@SenWarren And if you opened your eyes for 2 seconds, you would realize I will pay more taxes than any American in history this year
@jimcramer @TIME X is pretty great
@jimcramer @TIME Thanks Jim!
@BillyM2k 🤣
@SenWarren Please don’t call the manager on me, Senator Karen 🙏
